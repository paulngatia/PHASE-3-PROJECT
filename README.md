## Overview 
Approximately 70% of the earth's surface is made up of water, one of the few necessities shared by all living things. Although there is some scarcity on land, regrettably, 96.5 percent of its coverage is made up of waters. Tanzania is among the nations that struggle with the lack of this essential resource for survival. Due to scarce resources for water extraction, this developing country, home to more than 57,000,000 people, struggles to meet the demand for clean drinking water. While there are currently some water pumps in the nation, some are sadly out of commission and others require maintenance.

In the context of Tanzania, where this remains a persistent problem, predictive modeling emerges as a promising approach to enhance water resource management and optimize the drilling of new wells. By leveraging historical data, advanced statistical techniques, and machine learning algorithms, we aim to develop a robust predictive model that can accurately estimate the potential success and yield of water wells across different regions in Tanzania.

## 1. Business Understanding
#### Problem statement
Despite efforts to improve water access in Tanzania, my stakeholder, The Ministry Of Water- (MOW) also finds that three out of ten people still lack access to clean water, highlighting the critical need for investment to improve water hygiene and accessibility. Water poverty has been considered to drive serious illnesses, high infant mortality rates, poor education, slumped economies and unproductive agricultural conditions in a majority of the regions. 

The existing approach to drilling water wells in Tanzania relies heavily on experience and local knowledge, which often leads to inconsistent results and ineffective resource utilization. Moreover, the scarcity of reliable data and the complex interplay of geological, hydrological, and climatic factors pose additional barriers to identifying suitable well locations and estimating their potential yield accurately.
