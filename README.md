## Overview 
Approximately 70% of the earth's surface is made up of water, one of the few necessities shared by all living things. Although there is some scarcity on land, regrettably, 96.5 percent of its coverage is made up of waters. Tanzania is among the nations that struggle with the lack of this essential resource for survival. Due to scarce resources for water extraction, this developing country, home to more than 57,000,000 people, struggles to meet the demand for clean drinking water. While there are currently some water pumps in the nation, some are sadly out of commission and others require maintenance.

In the context of Tanzania, where this remains a persistent problem, predictive modeling emerges as a promising approach to enhance water resource management and optimize the drilling of new wells. By leveraging historical data, advanced statistical techniques, and machine learning algorithms, we aim to develop a robust predictive model that can accurately estimate the potential success and yield of water wells across different regions in Tanzania.

## 1. Business Understanding
#### Problem statement
Despite efforts to improve water access in Tanzania, our stakeholder, The Ministry Of Water- (MOW) also finds that three out of ten people still lack access to clean water, highlighting the critical need for investment to improve water hygiene and accessibility. Water poverty has been considered to drive serious illnesses, high infant mortality rates, poor education, slumped economies and unproductive agricultural conditions in a majority of the regions. 

The existing approach to drilling water wells in Tanzania relies heavily on experience and local knowledge, which often leads to inconsistent results and ineffective resource utilization. Moreover, the scarcity of reliable data and the complex interplay of geological, hydrological, and climatic factors pose additional barriers to identifying suitable well locations and estimating their potential yield accurately. 

As the project's data scientist, it will be our responsibility to find patterns in the broken wells so that we might have an impact on the construction of new ones. Additionally, by utilizing these trends, we will empower our stakeholders to precisely forecast the water locations that currently want attention, guaranteeing that Tanzanians have access to clean, drinkable water.

#### Objectives

- Create a reliable prediction model for Tanzanian water wells by utilizing statistical methods and machine learning algorithms. Based on the determined influential elements, the model ought to provide an accurate assessment of the possible success rate and yield of water wells.
- To determine the primary factors that have a major impact on Tanzanian water wells' functionality, conduct a detailed analysis of the dataset.

#### Research questions
* Which machine learning algorithms and statistical approaches are most suited for developing a precise predictive model for Tanzanian water wells?  
* How can the prediction model be improved and verified to guarantee its accuracy and applicability?

#### Success criteria
##### Business success criteria
* There should be a discernible rise in Tanzania's success rate for installing water wells as a result of the predictive modeling study. 
* Correctly identifying a well's functionality and assessing its feasibility are important aspects of the project. 

##### Project success criteria
Generating a model that will be able to correctly predict the quality status of the wells in Tanzania with an accuracy of 75%.

## 2. Data Understanding

In this project we shall use a dataset containing information about existing water wells in Tanzania  sourced from an ongoing  DrivenData competition.
