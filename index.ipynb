    "#### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people in Tanzania and millions of other people worldwide still lack access to clean, safe water, despite the fact that water is a vital resource for life. A large segment of the Tanzanian populace struggles on a daily basis to obtain adequate and dependable supplies of water. In addition to having an impact on their health and general well-being, this problem impedes socioeconomic advancement and feeds the poverty cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of its 59 million inhabitants, 16 million (28% of the total) do not have access to clean water, and 44 million (73%) do not have access to well run home sanitary facilities. Significant obstacles still stand in the way of guaranteeing all communities in Tanzania have consistent, sustainable access to clean water, despite efforts to enhance water access. Insufficient predictive models for water wells make it difficult to plan and allocate resources effectively, which leads to poor well yields, insufficient maintenance plans, and inefficient drilling sites. Communities thus still experience a lack of clean water, health hazards from tainted water sources, and financial difficulties.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Tanzania, the current method of drilling water wells is primarily based on experience and local knowledge, which frequently results in uneven outcomes and inefficient use of resources. In addition, the lack of trustworthy data and the intricate interactions between geological, hydrological, and climatic factors make it difficult to pinpoint appropriate well locations and precisely estimate the potential yield of those locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a reliable prediction model for Tanzanian water wells by utilizing statistical methods and machine learning algorithms. Based on the determined influential elements, the model ought to provide an accurate assessment of the possible success rate and yield of water wells. \n",
    "* To determine the primary factors that have a major impact on Tanzanian water wells' functionality, conduct a detailed analysis of the dataset."
